#A list is an ordered list of items.
#A dictionary is for matching some items (called keys) with other items, called values.
#dict =  {key1 : value1, ..., keyN : valueN}
#Use dictionaries whenever you have to look up another value

#Many of the operations we do to strings, like concatenation, repeated addition, etc
#Can be done to lists.
#E.g:   [1, 2] + [3, 4] == [1, 2, 3, 4]
#       [1, 2] * 3 == [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
#       grades = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
#       grades[0] == 'A'
#       grades[2: 4] == ['C', 'D']
#       len(grades) = 6
#So lists are more general than strings, and string a a specific type of list
